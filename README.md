# buildboard
Buildboard is a platform to document, share, and monetize automotive builds. This repo hosts the prototype built with emergent.sh, focusing on clean UX for build documentation, structured data models for parts and shops, and AI-powered parsing of receipts, images, and video to create a centralized hub for enthusiasts and builders.
