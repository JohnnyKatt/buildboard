# Buildboard Prototype Prompt (v1)

Goal: Build a simple, clickable prototype to document car builds with linked parts.

Users:
- Enthusiast and Shop (role switcher is fine; no real auth needed).

MVP features:
1) Create a Build Profile
   - Vehicle basics (year, make, model), title, short summary, 1 cover photo.

2) Add Parts (manual + URL)
   - Fields: brand, part name (required); optional: SKU, fitment notes.
   - Add 1..n vendor links (label + URL). Show link preview (stub ok).

3) View Build
   - Sections: Hero, Summary, Parts list (with vendor chips), Timeline (items + notes).

4) Shop Profile (basic)
   - Name, location, bio, builds list.
   - “Request This Build” form posts a simple lead object (mock storage ok).

Constraints:
- Keep flows ≤ 3 steps; mobile-friendly UI.
- Save data in a simple schema (Build, Part, VendorLink, Shop, Lead).
- No real payments; show “earnings” as mock counters.
- Follow acceptance.md in repo root.

Success (demo tasks):
- Create & publish a build in ≤2 minutes.
- Add 5 parts with multiple vendor links.
- Submit a “Request This Build” lead to a Shop and see it listed.
